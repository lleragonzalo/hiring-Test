What I did was make the structure for the site realization in HTML:

header: <header>.
navigation menu: <nav>.
main content: <main>, with several subsections (in addition to the sidebar) represented by the <article>, <section>, and <div> elements.
sidebar: <aside>; often placed inside <main>.
footer: <footer>.

Clearly being a single screen in this case there are properties and characteristics that were not necessary to use.

After having the HTML structure I started to work the structure with Bootstrap to be able to generate this structure for the different devices and thus its responsive design.
with their respective grids, columns and the use of flexbox.

Once I had assembled the structure, I began to work on the styles and properties of the .css in order to generate the design and shape of the page with the greatest
similarity, copying the characteristics of the file Figma.
